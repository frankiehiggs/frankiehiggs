Hi! I'm currently working as a postdoc at the University of Bath. I research boundary effects in the Boolean model (also known as the random blob model, and sometimes continuum percolation) and related models, working with Mathew Penrose. 

I previously worked on random growth models in the complex plane as a PhD student with Amanda Turner at Lancaster University.

Most of the repositories on here are simulations or visualisation from these two families of mathematical models. They're usually very pretty! There are some more interactive simulations on my homepage.
